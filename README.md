[![Build Status](https://jenkins.nlx.io/job/nlx-release-master/badge/icon?style=plastic)](https://jenkins.nlx.io/) ![Repo Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-concept-lightgrey.svg?style=plastic)

NLX is an open source inter-organisational system facilitating federated authentication, secure connecting and protocolling in a large-scale, dynamic API landscape.

This repository contains all of the components to the current **Proof of Concept** of the [NLX Product Vision](https://docs.nlx.io/introduction/product-vision/). Do **not** use this code in production.

## Developing for NLX
Please find the latest documentation for using NLX on [docs.nlx.io](https://docs.nlx.io). This is a good place to start if you would like to develop an application or service that uses or provides API access over NLX.

## Questions and contributions
Read more on how to ask questions, file bugs and contribute code and documentation in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building and running an NLX network locally
If you want to develop locally, or run your own NLX network you need to get all of the components of the NLX network to run.

Make sure you have installed the following tools:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Also you will need to have [configured a `GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) with `${GOPATH}/bin` added to your `PATH`.
After you set the `GOPATH`, be sure to reopen your terminal/shell to be sure the environment variables have been set correctly.

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/VNG-Realisatie
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/VNG-Realisatie
git clone git@github.com:VNG-Realisatie/nlx.git
cd nlx
```

You can now start all the components with `docker-compose up`

You can now see what services are up and on what port you can reach them using `docker ps`
